### What is Project Euler?
> Project Euler is a website created back in 2001. It hosts a collection of around 600 different algorithm problems that get progressively harder, to the point where even people with math PhD's still struggle with them.
>
> This said, the first 100 problems are totally do-able by a new developer. Thousands of people have completed the first 100 Project Euler problems over the years.
>
> It's just brutally hard. Like... Dark Souls hard.

Here goes solutions to the problems on Project Euler.
